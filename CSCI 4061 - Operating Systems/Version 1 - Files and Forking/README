-PURPOSE-
This program determines the winner of an election by counting and tabulating votes from several regions, whose relationship to each other is defined in an input file.

-HOW TO COMPILE-
Type "make" in the terminal in the same directory as the Makefile and the source files (votecounter.c and makeargv.h). This will create the program "votecounter".

-HOW TO USE FROM SHELL-
Copy "votecounter" to the folder with the input files (if it's not there already) and change the current directory to that folder.
Type "./votecounter input.txt" into the terminal.
This should run the program on the input file. The output will be called "Output_Who_Won".

-DESCRIPTION-
This program creates a directed acyclic graph of nodes, with each node representing a region and its children representing its subregions. (If there is a cycle or multiple inheritance, the program will detect this and abort.)
On each region without subregions (i.e. leaf of the tree), it calls the "leafcounter" program, which counts up and records the number of votes received by each candidate.
On every other region except the largest (i.e. branch of the tree), it calls the "aggregate_votes" program, which takes the files outputted by that region's children and sums the number of votes received by each candidate.
On the largest region (i.e. root of the tree), it calls the "find_winner" program, which is like "aggregate_votes" but also includes a line in the output which declares the overall winner.

-INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS-
Joshua and I (Jacob) worked on the design together. He wrote some preliminary code to read lines from the input file. I expanded this code to full functionality and wrote the functions to parse input lines and execute nodes. Joshua identified and fixed a critical error that was causing the output to be written improperly. I then wrote the code that checked for loops or multiple inheritance, the code that deallocated memory upon program exit, and this readme file.
