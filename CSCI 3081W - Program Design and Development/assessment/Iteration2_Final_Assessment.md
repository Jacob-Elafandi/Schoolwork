# Iteration 2 Feedback

*Grader: Sam - marqu317@umn.edu*

This file contains the feedback for your iteration 2. If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to me (Sam) and we can resolve them.

Note: This file entails 2 separate components of the iteration 2 grading: Code Submission and refactoring/unit tests. Code submission is the grade on your final code turn in for interfaces, function, etc. Refactoring/Unit tests refers to the initialization refactor you did and the unit tests your wrote for the sensors.

## Refactoring and Unit Tests

This is the grade for the initialization refactor you were asked to do and the sensor unit tests you turned in early in interation 2.
